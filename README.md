# Melanoma Detection
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- Trying to detect potential presence of melanoma.
- The dataset being used is an image dataset "Skin cancer ISIC The International Skin Imaging Collaboration".

## Conclusions
- Without dropout layer the accuracy is low and has tremendous overfitting.
- With Data Augmentation and Dropout layer the overfitting has been resolved but accuracy still remains an issue.
- Class rebalance has helped in the improvement of the accuracy.
